# Altium-Open-Source-Libraries
Open Source Libraries for Altium Designer

Include Various components, modules and whatsoever

##How to use

In every library folder you'll find one or more of the following files type:
* .SchLib (the schematic part of the library)
* .PcbLib (the footprints for the components in the library)
* .LibPkg (the library project, if you want to modify it)
* .IntLib (the compiled, ready-to-use Library


The only file you need is the .IntLib one. Just copy it into your project folder and add it with "add existing to project" (right click on you project file)
Then, you'll find the new library in the "add part" window.
